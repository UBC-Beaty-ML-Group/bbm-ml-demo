# UBC Beaty Biodiversity Museum - Similar Leaves Tool

This sub-project aims to create a simple program where the user can detect all similar herbarium specimens to a provided reference within a given database.

The user will first need to initialize a database they wish to search within, the plan of this section is to allow remote (for testing) and online (for scalable usage) databases.

The user can then input any "base" reference image of a herbarium sample, and the program will return all similar images within a specified confidence interval.
